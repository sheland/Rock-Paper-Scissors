# Rock Paper Scissors!

To become familar with the C# language, I created a simple CLI program where a user can play the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game against the computer. To win, the user or the computer has to be the first to score 3 points.


## Tasks tackled 
- Accept user input (rock, paper or scissors) 
- Generate random choice by the computer (rock, paper or scissors) 
- Compare choices made by the user and computer 
- Declare a winner 
- Repeat if user wants to play again
